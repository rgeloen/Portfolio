        <h3>Space X</h3>
        <p> Front-end school project about Space X. We choose here to develop an informative site, which aims to show in detail the life course of a Falcon 9. We trace her path, from her conception to the nature of the missions she carries out.

        <p>Back-end school project, in which we need to use at least one API and use PHP/MySQL. We choosed to be greedy with proposing a PokemonGo-like game, in which you are a super hero and need to save your city, in winning many missions indicated on your map</p>

        <h3>Cumulus</h3>
        <p>PHP project, this time we needed to use at least 2 API's, with PHP, in order to make a weather forecast application. I decided to use a meteo API of course, but also <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.teleport.org/api/getting_started/" target="_blank">the Teleport api</a>, which provided me many data on urban areas.</p>

        <p>Graphic design project, on which we were asked to do a matte painting, with the thema of a near future on Earth.
